## Introduction

When I use coding agents, I often need to retrieve details from a Sentry issue to provide context for diagnosing the root cause. Iâ€™ve been using the Sentry MCP for this, but I wanted to switch to a simpler command-line tool. I assumed `sentry-cli` would fit the bill, until I realized itâ€™s designed for a different purpose (per their docs):

```text
Itâ€™s primarily used for managing debug information files for iOS, 
Android as well as release and source maps management for other platforms.
```

At this point I realised I needed a different CLI. I tried to search around but I couldn't find exactly what I was looking for, so I decided to give it a shot.

## What is Sentire?

[Sentire](https://github.com/andreagrandi/sentire) is a simple and user-friendly command line interface for the Sentry API, written in Go. The name "sentire" comes from Italian, meaning "to feel" - reflecting its purpose of helping developers feel the pulse of their application's health through Sentry's monitoring data.

Sentire provides an intuitive CLI for interacting with Sentry's API, covering essential operations including managing events, issues, projects, and organizations.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Output Formats**: JSON, table, text, and markdown formats to suit different use cases
- **Comprehensive API Coverage**: Essential Sentry operations for debugging workflows
- **Built-in Pagination and Rate Limiting**: Handles Sentry's API constraints automatically
- **Human-readable Output**: Perfect for terminal usage and quick analysis
- **Machine-readable JSON**: Ideal for scripting and automation
- **URL Inspection**: Parse Sentry URLs directly to get detailed event information

**Note:** this CLI doesn't implement (yet) all the Sentry API. I focussed on the commands needed to retrieve projects, issues and events. More commands will be added in future releases.

## Installation

Install via Homebrew (macOS):

```bash
brew tap andreagrandi/tap
brew install sentire
```

For other installation methods (Go install, pre-built binaries, building from source), see the [official README](https://github.com/andreagrandi/sentire#installation).

Complete **source code** is available on GitHub: https://github.com/andreagrandi/sentire

## Getting Started

First, set your Sentry API token as an environment variable:

```bash
export SENTRY_API_TOKEN=your_sentry_api_token_here
```

You can obtain an API token from your Sentry organization settings under "Auth Tokens".

Then you can start exploring your projects and issues:

```bash
# List all your projects
sentire projects list

# Get a specific project
sentire projects get <organization> <project>

# List recent issues for an organization
sentire events list-issues <organization> --query="is:unresolved" --period=24h

# Get detailed information about a specific issue
sentire events get-issue <organization> <issue-id>
```

## Output Formats

Sentire supports multiple output formats to suit different workflows:

- **JSON** (default): Machine-readable format for scripting
- **Table**: Human-readable format with borders for terminal viewing
- **Text**: Clean plain text format for simple parsing
- **Markdown**: Documentation-friendly format for reports

```bash
# Human-readable table format
sentire events list-issues my-org --format table

# Markdown format for documentation
sentire org stats my-org --format markdown
```

## URL Inspection

One of Sentire's unique features is the ability to parse Sentry URLs directly:

```bash
# Inspect a Sentry issue URL and get detailed event information
sentire inspect "https://my-org.sentry.io/issues/123456789/"
```

This automatically extracts the organization and issue ID from the URL and fetches the most relevant debugging information.

## Use Cases

Sentire is particularly useful for:

- **Debugging Workflows**: Quickly inspect Sentry URLs and get detailed event information without leaving the terminal
- **DevOps Teams**: Integrating error monitoring into deployment pipelines with machine-readable JSON output
- **On-call Engineers**: Using table format for quick issue triage and markdown format for incident reports
- **Development Teams**: Multiple output formats reduce context switching between terminal and web interface
- **Automation and Scripting**: Built-in rate limiting and pagination make it reliable for automated workflows
- **Documentation**: Markdown output format perfect for including error analysis in reports and documentation

## Conclusion

Sentire brings Sentry to your terminal because, let's be honest, who has time to click around web interfaces when bugs are breathing down your neck? 

It's open source, so if you find bugs (oh, the irony!), have feature requests, or just want to make it less terrible, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/andreagrandi/sentire/issues) or send a pull request. I hope you will enjoy it ðŸ™‚
