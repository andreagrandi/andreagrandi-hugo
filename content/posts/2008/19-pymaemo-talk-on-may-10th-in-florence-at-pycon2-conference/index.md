**PyCon2** is the second edition of the [Italian Python Conference](http://www.pycon.it/) and will
take place on **May 9/10/11**, 2008 in **Florence**.

The conference is organized by **Python Italia** and more than
**300** developers, students and researchers
will be present for three days of tutorials and other important events.

PyCon 2008 edition will be opened by **Richard Stallman** with a keynote on **Free Software** and **Free Ethics**. 
Other famous developers will be presento too: **Alex Martelli**, **Samuele Pedroni**, **Brian Fitzpatrick** and many other.

I'll partecipate at the conference as speaker on May 10, with a talk on **PyMaemo: Python for Nokia Internet Tablets**.
In particular I'll talk about Maemo platform, Maemo SDK (how to install and configure it) and I'll explain how to use the two Eclipse plugins
[ESBox](http://esbox.garage.maemo.org/) and [Pluthon](http://pluthon.garage.maemo.org/).

If you want to give me any suggestion or idea for this talk, please
leave me a comment on this post, so I'll integrate it with my slides.
