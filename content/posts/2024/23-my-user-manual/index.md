---

This is my [**user manual**](https://futureforum.com/2022/07/15/personal-user-manual/). If we are working together (or planning to), please read it carefully. You will **learn how to deal with me productively** and avoid misunderstandings. I initially wrote this for my current colleagues, but I thought it could be a good idea to make it public for everyone else I daily interact with.

## My style

* I need to understand **why** I'm doing something
* I love working as a part of a team, not as an individual
* I love pair programming
* I like to have a very basic working version first and iterate on it
* I love to help

## What I value

* honesty
* direct and straight communication
* people who quickly get to the point
* leading by example

## What I donâ€™t have patience for

* process for the sake of process
* long meetings where no actions are taken at the end
* indirect feedback (heard from third parties)

## How best to communicate with me

* chat (public channel unless it's personal)
* email is ok...ish
* absolutely not by phone

## How I make decisions

1) I need some context first
2) I understand the problem
3) I draft some options and evaluate them
4) I pick the one which is less complicated but at the same time doesn't prevent further improvements
5) I iterate and improve the implemented solution

## How to help me

* give me **cooking tips not ready meals!** - I appreciate help and I don't hesitate asking for it when I need, but whenever I do I like to be given tips to unblock me not a ready solution or someone else doing the task for me.
* offer me to do **pair programming**

## Random things I like

* dogs (especially Basset Hounds)
* music (listening to and playing acoustic guitar, bass guitar and analogic synths)
* cooking
* photography
* learning new cool things

## Random things I dislike

* warm beer
* Italian food blasphemy (like putting pineapple on pizza, "fettucine Alfredo", etc... ðŸ˜œ )
