Recently I finally restarted to read indie blogs more regularly. To do that [I'm using NetNewsWire](/posts/simple-solution-to-read-rss-content-on-ios-macos), a free and open-source RSS reader for macOS and iOS and every time somone posts an interesting article, for example on Mastodon, I make sure to follow the RSS feed of that blog.

In a few weeks, I've collected a list of blogs that I follow and I thought it would be nice to share it with you. I'm trying to read less mainstream news and more personal blogs, because I think that the personal touch of a blog is what makes it interesting and unique.

## Some of the blogs I follow

Here are some of the blogs I follow and recommend. I try to read all the blogs I follow, but these surely are the ones I read more often:

### Brain Barking

- **Author**: [dr. Wouter Groeneveld](https://brainbarking.com)

A blog about tech, games and food.

### Jeff Triplett's Micro.blog

- **Author**: [Jeff Triplett](https://micro.webology.dev)

Jeff is a DjangoCon organiser and a Python Software Foundation Fellow. He writes about Django, Python, and other tech topics.

### Juha-Matti Santala

- **Author**: [Juha-Matti Santala](https://hamatti.org)

Juhis writes a lot! About tech, life, and about writing. He often inspires me to write more.

### Terence Eden's Blog

- **Author** [Terence Eden](https://shkspr.mobi/blog)

Terence writes about tech, privacy, and other interesting topics.
He often writes about very original gadgets and services and I always learn something new from him.
Bonus point, he's also a very nice person!

## Tell me about your blog!

I'm always looking for new blogs to follow, especially if they are indie blogs. If you have a blog and you think it's worth reading, **please let me know** either as a reply on Mastodon, or leaving a comment on the [gist](https://gist.github.com/andreagrandi/3226460db523a4c60e72f22e9ad896e9) on GitHub.
