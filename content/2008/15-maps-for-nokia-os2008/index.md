I report this news from [Andrew Jorgensen](http://andrew.jorgensenfamily.us/) (Monologue):

The Map application for Nokia’s OS2008 (for N800 and N810) lets you
download map data for a number of regions. The USA-West and USA-East
regions are very large, though, and I have never been able to download
them — it always fails about half way through. I know others have dealt
with the same problem.

This morning I got a reply from Wayfinder Customer Support:

Instructions for installing the map data are on that site. It’s still a
slow download but at least you can use a download manager.
