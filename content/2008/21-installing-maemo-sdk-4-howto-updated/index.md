I've updated my previous howto that explain how to install **Maemo SDK 4 (Chinook)**.
The other howto was written when Maemo SDK 4 Beta was out, now it's updated to
**4.0.1** version of the SDK.

You can find it, as usual, on this wiki: <http://www.ptlug.org/wiki/Howto_Installing_Maemo_SDK_4>

If you have any suggestion or if you want to give me any idea to improve
this howto, please leave me a comment.
